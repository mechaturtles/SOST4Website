// In a real-world implementation, requests to third-party APIs would be done here. It is not possible to make outbound network requests using Firebase's Free Plan, so a workaround is done here so that the client processes the request. 
// This is, however, a terrible idea in real production but is only done to demonstrate our ability to interface with third-party devices and is by no means a permanent solution.
