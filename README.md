# SOST4Website
This is the repo for the Techpoint SOS Challenge - Telehealth Team 4.
We are ConnecTech, a team of innovators who aim to connect and process existing health solutions into one friendly platform.
Our main product is myHealthRadar, a platform designed to integrate with many popular health devices and wearables from companies such as Dexcom, Fitbit, Omron, and more. We strive to deliver the best user experience while working closely with our customers to continually improve our products. 

We also strive to offer providers analytical tools to properly evaluate patient health. This is accomplished with myHealthInsights--a library of functions that run in the background to notify patients and providers of any concerning health trends. These models are developed around documented research and what data we are given by health device companies.

You can checkout our project at [sosth4.web.app](https://sosth4.web.app/) although it will eventually be taken down.
